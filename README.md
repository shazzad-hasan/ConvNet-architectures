# Training Re-producible Deep Learning Models

### ConvNet Architectures

- [LeNet-5](https://github.com/shazzad-hasan/training-reproducable-deep-learning-models/blob/main/LeNet-5/lenet5.ipynb) was one of the earliest ConvNets used to classify MNIST digits in 1998. Here,  `lenet5_mnist.ipynb` trains the model on MNIST dataset. [[paper](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf)]
- [AlexNet](https://github.com/shazzad-hasan/training-reproducible-deep-learning-models/tree/main/AlexNet) is the 2012 ImageNet winner. It achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the runner-up. Here, `alexnet_cifar10` trains the model on CIFAR10 dataset.
